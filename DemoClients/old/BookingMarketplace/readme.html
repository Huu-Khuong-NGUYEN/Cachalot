<p>This demo client implements a toy booking site, as described in the user guide (it can be found <a href="https://github.com/usinesoft/Cachalot/blob/master/Doc/CachalotUserGuide.pdf">here&gt;&gt;</a>)</p>
<p>It is mostly a showcase of the massive feeding and querying capabilities of the database.</p>
<p>To run this client, a server must be started on port <strong>4848</strong>. ( which is the default unless specified otherwise in <strong>node_config.json</strong>)</p>
