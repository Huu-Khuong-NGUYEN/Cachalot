<p>This demo client implements a toy banking system where amounts of money are transferred between accounts and <strong>money transfers</strong> are recorded.</p>
<p>It proves the advanced transactional capabilities of Cachalot Db including the <strong>optimistic synchronization</strong>.
About 15% of the transactions are supposed to be rolled back and the consistency of the rollback is checked.</p>
<p>The application tests transactional performance in 3 cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>single server</li>
<li>a cluster of two servers</li>
<li>an in-process server</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to run this example application, three servers need to be started on ports: <strong>4848,4851,4852</strong></p>
<p>The port is specified in <strong>node_config.json</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the dotnet-core server, command scripts are available <strong>start4848.cmd ...</strong></p>
