Running "booking marketplace"
==============================================
This demo client implements a toy booking site as described in the user guide (That can be found in the "Doc" directory)
It is mostly a showcase of the massive feeding and querying capabilities of the database
To run this client, a server must be started on the 4848 port. 4848 is the default unless otherwise specified in node_config.json
