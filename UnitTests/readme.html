<p>The script run_tests.cmd is provided as a convenience.
One test fixture needs an external server to be running on port 6666. The port can be configured in tne node_config.json file
This command line will run all unite tests, once for each platform.
All the unit tests are run before a release together with lots of manual testing.</p>
