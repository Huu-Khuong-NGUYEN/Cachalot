          "I was invited to a golf outing being held here on the links course.  I do not have my own clubs so I called a few days prior to the event and asked if they rented clubs. \nThe girl states that they do and she needs to call her manager to get the rates. She came back on the phone and said that because I am part of the outing there will be no charge.  I asked her to repeat that and then happily said goodbye. \nI had a few guys offer me clubs for the outing and I said no because i was getting them from the club. \nYeah, went in and talked with some guy named Chad, who in short should be fired and not allowed to deal with the public. Most unprofessional guy around. \nHe would not honor the free clubs and wanted to charge me $77 for something that I was assured were on the outing. He went as far as swearing at me.  He stated,  I don't give a dam what you were told on the phone.  I don't care what the hell you are telling me. \nI stated back that he should not be dealing with the public.  \nHorrible, unprofessional service and the cart paths are junk.  They have put no money into the links course especially the cart paths.\nThey will never get my money.",

To top it off the cloth on the chairs was very dirty. \nThe servers could not care less about cracking a smile. When asked for the dumping menu I was given a photo album with just pictures. I then had to ask for another menu that had the description of dumplings. Upon this the server got irritated. \nThe food was super gross. The crab and corn soup had a bad fishy taste. The chicken balls were 90% batter and 10% chicken. They were also fried in an old oil. The only thing that was decent was the scallop dumplings. \nPlease avoid this place at all costs.

Unlike some other Chinese restaurants, this location does not provide a complimentary pork bone Chinese soup to start.  But they do provide complimentary red mung bean soup.\n\nI was treating caucasian clients.  I was very happy that they did not offend my clients asking if they wanted forks and knifes -thank you.  Eventually they needed and we were served.\n\nWe were provided one pot of tea, eventually two pots but the tea leaves were not replenished and so tea was quite washed and light.\n\nAt the end of our dinner, we were served red mung bean soup.  It was moderately sweet.  It was okay, but quite filling because it's made with glutinous flour or just boiled too long that the tapioca has thickening it.  I give the server props for observing my caucasian clients did not like it and quickly came to the rescue with fortune cookies -to that my client were like \"Yea! Awesome!\"\n\nIt could be five star, but two reasons stopped me.\n\nFirst, at a previous visit for dim sum, I found that when I had caucasian clients with kids, the servers take advantage of the kids amusement with crab claw dim sums because kids like playing with food.  I will honestly say it's pretty pricey to order half a dozen of premium dim sum dishes.\n\nSecond, this restaurant does not serve any dishes that are diabetic/high cholesterol customers.  I can never take health sensitive clients for dim sum and the dinner options really don't have clean options.",

Only downside was that we had a large party, and when a cart comes by, we'd take a couple of plates, but all the food would be gone in a minute. We would then have to sit a while waiting for the next cart to come over and since we were in the far corner, carts were few and far between.",

However, the lack of customer service pissed me off. My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didn't even have; the manager literally got up in my uncle's face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that they're going to call the police.

They will mark down the types of dishes you got, which will add to your total. Different carts have different items, but the same carts will come around quite often.\nIt's a great way to eat with your eyes, picking food that looks good and they taste good too!

We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle. \n\nWe ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there! So much for pacing how much we eat. \n\nThe dim sum was delicious. Some of my favourites are the following:\n- Crab claw balls (so good, especially the meat in the claw)\n- Har gow\n- Sticky rice in fragrant leaves\n- Rice rolls (shrimp and barbeque pork)\n\nI had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish. I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish. \n\nWe split the bill. Each person ended up paying $22, which included the tip. I was good with it. My boss said that it was expensive. This restaurant accepts credit, debit, and cash. \n\nThe dim sum quality was amazing. This restaurant houses a ton of people. At one point, a tour bus full of tourists came in. I would guess that it easily seats 200 people. \n\nI'd come back here again. It's fully licensed, which is another reason why I need to come back.  \n\n(215)",

Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so I'm a little behind. The place is huge - banquet style seating. They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so it's very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTA.\n\nThe choice is yours: Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu. From their \"Har Gau\" shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings, you can always find something good to eat here. When I first arrived at Emerald, I didn't quite know what to expect. It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby. What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy. I am telling you all, the food is very good here.\n\nDim sum carts: Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay. Noodles and veggies are cheaper. Seafood items are higher in cost. If you love seafood as much as I do, you won't mind paying for it.\n\nMenu: I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great. If you order the crab, it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget. When dining here with out-of-town family or friends, I would always recommend buying the crab.\n\nSo what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment. You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service. As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays, I'm listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the \"five-star\" eating experience.\n\nTip #1: Plan wisely - Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse. Unless you are absolutely craving their food, beware of rushed and rude service.\nTip #2: All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts. You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price. But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out. The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours. I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishes.\nTip #3: When you need some service, get their attention! Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests. They are the ones you need to order from so don't be shy and call them over. \nTip #4: When asking for something, no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you. When speaking with us needy/hungry/polite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders. Just say what you need and follow up when they forget. If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcome.\n\nFor more food reviews and blogging, check out my blog at https://spicychopsticks.blog",

Any later and you'll be trapped in a crowd of chaos! \n- The manager lady always tries to sell a couple dishes that she runs around with. Don't get them! They are usually the older items that wasn't sold\n- Theres an automatic charge for \"tea\" per person, consider that when tipping \n- If there is a certain item you want and cant seem to find on the carts, just ask the people in the black vest. They can always preorder for you. \n- be ready to eat!!",

After browsing the menu and a brief discussion with our waiter, we ordered seafood noodles and a 3 item mix meat plate (BBQ pork, chicken, and duck)\n\nThe food came soon thereafter and it was hot and delicious.  There was large portions and lots of seafood in the seafood noodles and the mix meat plate came with good cuts of meat and the correct sauces.\n\nAfter the meal, we received fortune cookies for dessert.\n\n\nFood\nThe food was good quality.  Ingredients tasted fresh and dishes tasted well made.  Food is above average but nothing stood out even though I was quite hungry.\n\nPrice\nPrice is high in comparative to other Chinese cuisine, and comparable to large western restaurant chains.\n\nService:\nThe service is average to slightly below average.  A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiter/waitresses are overworked, impatient, unattentive.  Emerald Chinese is no exception.  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient.  All our services needs were met, but the staff was rushed and grumpy..\n\nDecor\nEmerald has tasteful decorations, comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths.  There is sufficient room to navigate between tables.\n\n\nOverall, we had a good meal with large portions, received average service and paid slightly more than we had hoped for our meal.\n\n3.1 / 5.0",

It started out badly from the beginning when a member of my party asked for a fork and the server told them they couldn't have one until after we place an order - which is complete nonsense! After the food was ordered we requested hot sauce. The servers did not even want to take the time to let us finish our words before they walked away begrudgingly to get the wrong sauce. Next the food came, it was all lukewarm and mediocre at best. Heavily lacking spices and any semblance of flavour. Lastly to add insult to injury our bill arrived; We watched as all the other tables around us enjoyed their oranges and fortune cookies as their bills arrived that for some reason we were not treated to. I guess we didn't \"qualify\" for them?!\n\nThis is my first review and I felt so compelled by the horrible food and even worst service that i felt it was my duty to warm others. Go elsewhere!

Very elaborate and ornate decor (think gold seat covers), seating to fill a legit army (this place is huge - if you're looking to seat a large group, this is a good place to start), and good variety to the menu and dim sum carts. \n\nIt isn't the cheapest dim sum spot in the area, but if your main concern is making reservations and ensuring space for a larger group of people, this is a safe bet. The food itself is pretty decent - food from the menu is a decent size, tasty, and comes out quickly. There's good variety to the dim sum choices, lots of dishes to choose from, and the carts come by often. \n\nOverall, a decent choice. Note: they also take reservations.",

          "I've been a frequent at this place for years, enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family. And I have to say, this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunch.\n\nFirst of all, the place is HUGE. My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings, events, gatherings, and we usually get a good experience. On some days when you come at a busy time, it's not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are! I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated, but maybe this has changed?\n\nFOOD! I honestly think it's great here, though it is a bit expensive for what it offers. I prefer the lunch dim sum, letting them wheel carts as you take your pick. It's nice because I'm definitely not a decisive person, so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts. A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things (? lol), the siu mai, dumplings, they're all very good. I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here, they're cooked well and I've never had any rubbery or overcooked meat.\n\nSERVICE is all pretty good too imo, a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so it's not too hard for us. They're usually fast too, bringing drinks/sauces/plates when we ask right away. \n\n\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to people! The reason it's a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing; often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them. However, I love coming back at lunch, I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience. Actually I go almost every week and I've not noticed any drop in quality, so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for now!",

We came right before 2pm so maybe the timing something to do with it but I'm told their dim sum is on till 4pm.\n\nThe har gow was the worst I've ever had, and I rarely get to say that about har gow. The shrimp was tiny, rubbery, and it tasted \"off\". I was just glad we didn't get sick off it. It tasted completely different from how they used to do it here so I'm not sure if they used a bad batch, but if so it shouldn't have been served in the first place. Another staple, the shiu mai, was also pretty bad. It was tasty usually but it was tiny and I'm not sure if it had any fish egg topping either. If it did, it wasn't noticeable. The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year. Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing, there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it. We also ordered some fried pork & veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold. The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess. Stuff like this should be basic! The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce. The xiao long bao was also decent.\n\nOverall, it seems like they're skimping on everything that costs money now. Despite that, prices are higher than other dim sum spots. That's not a good combination. I hope the owner recognizes this soon because it'd be a shame for one of the few good dim sum spots in the city to keep on this path.",

Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant - golds and reds, fish tank, things weren't new but not too old. There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservations.\n\nThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular à la carte menu. My table ordered off the à la carte, probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we want.\n\nThe soup came out first - it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible, but the taste was watery and bland. It was also apparent the service was going to feature kind-hearted ladies with fair-to-average serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place, literally.\n\nOther dishes came out eventually, featuring sweet and sour pork, thousand island sauce deep fried pork, egg tofu with baby shrimp, garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce, XO sauce string beans, fish fillet with peas...a collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home, but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner. Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done, though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected. There were no food-related complaints around the table otherwise. Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup - standard, nothing special.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing - my table of 16 came out to only $16.50 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes. While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either, which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party. Personally - I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill, but for being in Mississauga it wasn't bad at all.",

          "My family and I were at Emerald yesterday during the busiest point of dim sum traffic. All I can say is, it is total mayhem. There weren't any lines during the time we were there, but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before. The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly. I can't really blame them, I get it. When you have a good thing, capitalize on it. Though, this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I don't particularly find enjoyable.\n\nThere is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good. When it comes to dim sum, they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant. Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish. Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be. Again, a symptom of the style of restaurant. \n\nService was perfunctory at best. Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares. Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it (in as few words as possible).\n\nOverall, 3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be. But the food is actually not bad.",

The decor... Weird looking yellow chairs, ceiling has water/mold stains and the TV is showing Slice.\n\nWe were taken to our table by a middle-aged Asian man, who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language, as he spoke like Dr. Frankenstein's monster. There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty. Then another manager, this time a female, approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings. We said yes, but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart, that were sitting by the front door. The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat.  \n\nNow, as for the menu... If you eat in as opposed to takeout, there is a price hike, supposedly because you are getting more food, so don't be surprised by the $15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetables.\n\nThe rice was just plain crap. No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice. The vegetables were the size of my fist (exaggerated), but damn folks, could you not cut them down to a manageable size?!\n\nAll that and I'm now $40 in the hole. No tip either, since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste and/or try to shovel it off to someone else. Failing that, trying to recook it back to some forms of dignity.\n\nShame on whoever cooks the food there, seriously.\n\nThe only plus? The cashier was real cute.",

Came with house soup (老火湯) and dessert (綠豆沙 and orange slices).\n\nThe braised beef was very good, if not a bit oily. The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked - not too mushy and not too crunchy. The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable (I would have expected a root vegetable, like carrots or turnips), but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquid.\n\nThe eggs were a bit uneven, with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked. The seafood (shrimp and scallop) was plentiful and tasty. My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily (but it's kind of to be expected with this dish).\n\nThe house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soup.\n\nService was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves. \n\nPrices were reasonable.\n\nOverall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents... but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if you're willing to go all the way east to Markham/Scarborough/etc.",

So i complained to the server, he didn't even acknowledge my complaint and just left. i told another server and he told me that  this is how they make it and left without even offering to provide a new one. Finally, a women server offered to get a new one and even agreed with us that it was old. But it took about 20 minutes and all we had was the rice and bok choy. By the time they brought it out we just weren't hungry anymore, considering we did not want to eat the chicken by itself and our rice was already cold. Only exception is the sweet older lady who served us the rest of servers were rude. One server, even went to the table beside us to check the bill to see how much tip a couple had gave after they left. We heard him mention tip as he looked at the bill and threw it back down angry. Disgusting, will not return.",

I was reminded of why we don't really go there anymore...\n\n1)  The layout: Depending on where you sit, you may get hot dim sum fresh off the carts, or you may get that cart that has \"onesies\" of everything left over....which implies you may have to wait quite awhile for that one item you've been jonesing for.  You could order it too, but that can take some time.  \n\n2)  The quality:  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's meh.  It's rarely excellent. \n\n3)  The wait:  OMGoodness.  On a Sunday morning at noon, you can expect a hefty wait especially if you're in a group larger than 4.  I don't even attempt Saturday morning.  I'd have to assume that the rush dies down after 2 pm but don't quote me on that!\n\nI'd say it's a good place to go if you're a dim sum newb and you like to see the items before you order them.  But otherwise there are better options out there.",

The food off the carts is more often than not cold which doesn't help. \n\nBasically they have enough Dim Sum carts for a restaurant a quarter of the size. Its actually quite comical watching other diners constantly looking around for carts and crying out in unison \"Where is the food!\". \n\nIf you want to wait over an hour just to get a few standard Dim Sum dishes that are available quickly anywhere else than go for it.

It can get pricey and that's how a lot of dim sum places get you!\n\nI see some of the other reviewers saying how you had to be firm and you do. All the cart ladies want to pawn their food on you... Especially if you aren't Asian... Also, if you want to order anything off the menu or even get extra napkins, you will have to flag down one of the servers in the black vests. They take their division of labour very seriously.\n\nYou should order a side of the stir fry snow peas. They don't normally bring that out.

If you're not very good at saying No, lol you're so screwed it's not even funny.\n\nEmerald is (as has been described to me) a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place. This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers, YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. \n\nThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them. Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times, you just have to be patient. The ladies (never seen a dude wheeling the carts) will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table (for which you will be charged), so you have to say No multiple times. \n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin. I had no idea what 90% of the food was. Luckily, the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all. The food is different, so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things. Sometimes the food looked like things I'd find growing between my toenails, but tasted like heaven should taste. Leave your inhibitions at home.\n\nIt is WELL worth it. I'm now a huge fan of pork dumplings (as seen in other posts) and glazed pork buns! I can even order for myself now without going all doe-eyed in the face of the waiters! (I'm pretty proud of that)\n\nTL;DR: Go to Emerald with someone that speaks Mandarin or understand restaurants like this. Learn to say No. Leave your inhibitions at home.",

Although the decor is nice with bright lights, white tablecloths and golden chair covers, it's ultimate downfall is the food. \n\nThe majority of dim sum items were deep fried. Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls? Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart. Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing. Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin. These were very thick. \n\nI asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a \"shrimp biscuit\". I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground pork.\n\nThe staff were awful. Apart from yelling at each other from across the room, they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice. \n\nOne cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us. After asking for the fried noodles on her cart, she stamped our card, then said she would get us a warm plate. She disappeared, and we didn't see her again. We were about to ask someone about this, when another lady came with a plate of noodles. They were microwaved!!!! \n\nI think it's safe to say I'll never come back here again. There are so many other good dim sum places (Richmond Hill/Markham) that are definitely worth the drive. Do yourself a favour and don't eat here.",

Anyhow, we generally try not to come here as it's not a great Chinese restaurant but it's one of the very few Chinese restaurants that can hold a large group.  \n\nWe arrived with a table of 10 and we had reservations.  After being confused why we were told we had a 40 minute when we had reservations, we finally sat down after talking to the head hostess for 20 minutes.  This didn't start off our meal on the right foot,\n\nWe choose a smaller 'banquet' meal for 8 and supplemented with a few other dishes since we didn't like the really big banquet dinners.  The typical complimentary soup came out and the service was clearly not interested in 'service'.  The soup spilled all over the place when it was taken from the serving bowl to the smaller bowls.  This behaviour continued throughout the meal.  Most dishes were just thrown onto the table while the waiter often just pushed people aside to get to the centre of the table.  The only thing that saved the meal were the dishes.\n\nThough they weren't outstanding or great.... all the dishes were fairly well executed.  Nothing was greasy, oily, underseasoned, overseasoned, or burnt.  Steamed fish was fresh and light.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and moist.  Vegetables were nicely flavoured and still crispy.  The lobster could be better... it was on the scrawny side and it was hard to find any meat in there.  All in all ... nothing horrible among the 10 dishes we ordered.  \n\nIn comparison to the east end, this restaurant is probably just average but since we're in Mississauga, it stands to be one of the better ones.  It's too bad we don't have a great Mississauga Chinese restaurant.",

Luckily there are perks to being regulars at this restaurant: less wait time, attentive service, and the tea surcharge is waived. \n\nI generally go here because of the hustle & bustle atmosphere and because the dim sum is relatively consistent in quality. Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted? Probably not, but I still enjoy it because it's still one of the best, most popular, and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga (it's always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion - it indicates food is always made fresh for customers). If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town, this place is it! There's not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh & hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period (many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet, so it may take away from the experience if you've never tried this).\n\nIf you've never been to dim sum, I think going here would be a good experience. It's nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible. Some of the dishes I order regularly are: XO stir fried rice noodle rolls, spare ribs in black bean sauce, fried crab claw (a bit expensive, ~$5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure), fried seaweed roll.\n\nOnly negatives about this place could be: long wait times, not for people who dislike busy/loud environments, not for extremely starving people (you might have to wait if you can't find something you like right away on a cart), specialty/large dishes are expensive, not very wheelchair accessible (I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurant/plaza isn't that friendly for wheelchairs)",

There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering system...so just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food.

The food runs out quickly, so don't wait for it to come around again, it may be a while or never! They do a great job with the staple DS fare: Har gow (shrimp dumplings), Shui Mai (pork) and sticky rice. My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce. Try the Chinese greens, dumpling soup, and pork sesame seed buns. The spring rolls ( with meat filling) are awesome as well.\nThe best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays.

I come here all the time so I guess iv gotten used to the pricing. They open late almost every night, they close at 1 for most nights I think. Staff is friendly, but most of them don't speak alot of English, but there's one who speaks good English tho. I just don't like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom, looks sketchy. There's fish tanks with crab and other seafood...alive tho. And it right along where people sit down, and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet, that's the only thing I don't like...why couldn't they put this anywhere else? I don't know\nBUT overall good place, I'll still be coming here alot.",

          "We've come to Emerald for both dim sum and dinner before.  This review will be for dinner.\n\nOur group of 6 arrived around 7pm on a Friday night.  The restaurant was about half full.  They seated us at a round table that was a bit lop sided and unsteady because it was a piece of plywood screwed to some fold out table legs.  We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged. \n\nWe ordered one of the set menus for $88 which included:\n\n- House soup\n\n- 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions.  I don't eat crab that often but it's probably one of the best I've tasted.  Lots of meat, not too much work needed to dig it out.  The meat was very fresh and not overdone.  \n\n- Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy skin\n\n- Stirfry scallops and shrimps with veggies and jumbo mushrooms\n\n- Fish and deep fry tofu\n\n- Stirfry tung choi\n\nIn addition, we also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic and half a roast chicken.\n\nFood came fast and super hot.  Portions were gigantic especially the tofu/fish and snow pea leaves dishes.  Although we did have to order bowls of white rice separately as it was not included in the set menu.\n\nDessert was included and it was cold orange slices and a warm sweet taro/tapioca soup.\n\nOverall a fantastic meal and way more than enough food for 6 people.  We had 2 jumbo containers of leftovers with the bill coming to $140 before tip.",

The manager the day was such a cheat and liar and told my parents the price did not include the \"tip' so my parents being as trusting as they are gave them an extra $200 on top of it?!?!? \n\nI also had given each of our 3-4 servers a red pocket for luck.\n\nThey also book ours with another huge, large party with a microphone so it was really hard to hear anything when speeches or announcements were being made, especially for two of my best friends and their parents sitting at the table closest to the other rooms. A heads up would have been nice.\n\nI didn't find out til a week later when I went to ask my parents if they had change form the $1400 I handed them to pay with.

          "One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.\n\nMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.\n\n*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. \n\nThe staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It's what I expect.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.\n\nThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat.",

When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasn't a wait because that meant the food usually sat around.

I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce, wrapped sticky rice, Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.\n\nNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I'm describing the dishes... sorry but if you've been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out.

I was shocked, and then so I asked for more bowls. And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl. (What about everyone else)\n\nSome other servers are quite nice. If you need anything, try to flag down the guy in the suit/tie or the ladies in the black blazers. Anyone else will just throw things at you (figuratively)\n\nThey also again, tried to put stuff on our table, and I had to tell them to take it back. When she was confused what i wanted, I got yelled at. \n\nI think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better. It would be the managers serving you, not the others. \n\nNonetheless, the place is always packed full of the local asian folk, which is a good thing. I can understand why, it's cheap, and the food is quite decent (they can cook the short ribs a bit more).  This time with 5 people, we paid $11 a person. \n\nIf it wasn't for the only dim sum place in proximity, and my co-workers loving it so much, I wouldn't come back. \nI really don't need to be treated like a 2nd class citizen.",

We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll, donkotsu ramen and katsu jyu(pork cutlet with egg). \n\nAfter soft shell crab roll was served first, we waited for 30minutes for other dishes. They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend. The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waiting.\n\nThe ramen was served and soup was very rich but salty.(or was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accident?!)I liked the noodle though. Katsu jyu was katsu-don in a bento box style. Katsu was okay, not that crispy enough. I maybe expected too much(authentic japanese ramen and donkotsu) as I heard the owner was Japanese. They can do better. \nIt leaves a lot to be desired. 3stars for the food and 2stars for the service.",

I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce, they didn't have any. I was kind of disappointed. Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers. What it all really boils down to is, how good is that eel? Let me tell you, it's one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things I've put in my mouth! The eel was cut to perfection, huge portions might I add. In fact, it's hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that aren't cut up. Because it was cooked whole, it makes the eel that much more tender. If you've never had eel, you must try it! It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia, grilled with eel sauce, and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness. \nBut seriously, I need shrimp sauce or white sauce. Next time I may order it Togo and get shrimp sauce from somewhere else. Problem solved!",

No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping center.\n\nI like Musashi as it's small and intimate in there.  They have booths, tables, a small bar, but what I really like is to sit in their room.  It looks like you'd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor, but there is openings for you to hang your feet.  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the room!\n\nI prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck.  When you go in during lunch, make sure to look towards your right and you'll see A, B, C lunch options.  Those options aren't on the menu and change daily.  \n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the Ton-Kat-Su.  Man on man!  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life, this would be it.  It never disappoints!  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing!  If you think you can't get more salad dressing...YOU CAN!  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my heart's delight!\n\nThe staff here is really nice and you'll always see the same familiar faces when coming in.

We really wanted to like this place as a sushi/Asian alternative to some of our favorites including Sushi Guru, Tsuki, Futo Buta Asian18 etc.and much prefer the freshness and service they offer.\n\nThe staples to Japanese food are rice .which was good and seafood which was of mediocre quality. Most portions were small and pricey and not impressive. The limited lunch menu left a lot to be desired with many popular items only on the dinner menu such as teriyaki salmon, sushi, ramen etc. we had to ask for sushi menus which seemed to be a rare exception? \n\nWe may try dinner or carry out hesitantly and try to naviagate the good parts of their menu if they let us.

There are fancier LOOKING sushi places to be found in this town for sure, but purist Japanese sushi that caters to a very Japanese and Asian crowd? You'd be hard pressed to find more than a few of these at all.\n\nThe lunch special is great, especially the Chirashi Sushi which is pieces of sashimi on top of a bowl of seasoned sushi rice. The tempura appetizer is perfect with just the right amount of coating and a real ponzu dipping sauce with daikon radish in it. \n\nThis is not a place for fancy Americanized rolls.

Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique, authentic and delicious.

I'd expect it's more like $4.50 to $5 for two pieces. So for $2.95 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good, it's going to have to be pretty good, and unfortunately I'd rank it as even less than average. It's soft, pink, non-fatty and flavor-less flesh was sub-par compared to what I'm used to having. And I'll say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion.

We've waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time. When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger table/tatami styled table because we had a party of 7. Her response was \"uh no. \" I didn't understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away. The first time I went, after waiting an hour, one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at. It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldn't be seated. It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible. They need a bigger entrance, a hostess, and better management. They didn't give us enough menus or silverware and didn't ask what we wanted to drink. The floor is extremely sticky, not sure why I guess they don't clean the floors. As for the food, I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses. If you still decide to go, try the tenpura lunch or katsu-jyu. I tried to give them a second chance but I've never felt this disrespected before. Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future. Not happy at all. Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his. I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didn't provide me with one. How disappointing.",

We ordered large hot sake & a bottle of Sapporo. The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after. Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave. Fine, I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer, maybe the sake machine wasn't turn on. We ordered edamame & fried squid legs. They were both just ok, nothing really stood out. For the main course, we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen & a sushi roll. For the ramen, this is legit!  The broth is light & rich (not thick like other place). Only complaint was an overcooked egg. The roll?  Wife ate all of it since it had eel & I didn't really care for.  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro, ika, hamachi, spider roll, futo maki. Nothing was short of excellence!  Don't mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish, the quality was out of this world. This had to be the best quality we ever had (if you look at my review, we had also tried Nobu's Aspen. You know we are foodies!). We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total, all of which were the best. Overall, if you rate this place less than 5 stars, you are crazy!",

The staff is owned and run by a Japanese family -- huge plus, especially nowadays where you've got all these \"japanese\" restaurants run by Chinese, Korean or the East Asian people. It's always a good sign when you see other Japanese diners dining there. The ambience is simple and unassuming, allowing the food to speak for itself. The food here is AUTHENTIC! The sushi chef is intimidating looking and very serious about what he does. The sushi and sashimi are all very good - chirashi bowl, sashimi a la carte (uni, yellowtail, salmon roe, salmon, tuna). Their rolls taste fantastic too. We always go with the spicy yellowtail, Cali rolls and soft shell crab with avocado. Their cooked items are delicious too: grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps, any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles. Pair any of these items with some sake or beer.\n\nFYI - They take reservations and have a large separate room (shoes must be taken off) with two tables that can seat 8-10 ppl each. For these tables, you sit on the floor and legs can hang below. They have set lunch and dinner hours, and never pick up the phone unless they're open and not too busy. They open at 5:30 for dinner and we've arrived at 5:15 to see a line outside.\n\nHave an urge for some quality and authentic Japanese in Charlotte? Look no further.",

U can taste it in their croquette dipped in tonkatsu sauce. Mmmm. When I check out a new Japanese restaurant, I always go for the chirashi to see what hidden treasure I might discover and boy I think I had MIRUGAI in it!!! I don't think I was dreaming!?!!  Back in Japan, I missed the chirashi which had unique sashimi pieces like even awabi!!! This natsukashii omoi... Arigatoo Musashi! I will be back most certainly. It is not a fancy restaurant. Its portions do not speak in volume but rather in flavor. If you've bn to Japanese restaurants run by Chinese, you will b able to taste the difference. Some people rate by volume value. This is rated by aji flavor value.",

We were served after four other tables that arrived after us.  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea.  The tea seems powdered.   Husband got Shoyu Ramen, and I wanted chicken katsu curry, but the chicken katsu is $8, apparently it's five additional dollars for the curry sauce.  So i ordered the Tempura instead.   It was very good.  We also got pork shumai, but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on, and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush.  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good.   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom.  His noodles were very good, firm, stretchy, chewy, delicious.   Very good flavor in the broth.  \n\nWe will be back to give this place another shot, they just seemed a bit too busy and a little understaffed.  Also, we wont order the shumai again, it just didn't seem right to us.",

Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits, but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.  \n\nThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up, but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes, but I suppose that's unsurprising.\n\nMusashi is very casual, and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus, powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here's a rundown on what I had:\n\n- Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling, but you can do one piece each so everything's very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic!\n- Anago - delicious, buttery\n- ika - squid was a highlight, very light and with a touch of crunch\n- surf clam - also delicious, I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette\n- tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  \n- ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual\n- saba - marinated and tasty\n- hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\n- ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.  \n\nI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi, however, the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \n\n- hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices \n- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin\n- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don't do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish",

At 12 pm, the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny. There were a few booths, two small 2-top tables, a few larger tables pushed together and a separate, traditional dining area for larger parties.\n\nThey had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register. I ordered the lunch special A - rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen. The beau ordered the miso ramen. Overall, I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his. It really wasn't anything to rave about though. Pretty standard. Definitely not the best ramen I've had, but hey... It was Charlotte good. \n\nA few things I found annoying... The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best. I won't be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramen.",

Both of which are truly amazing! Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it, and the broth is fantastic!\n\nMy last visit (which was last Thursday), I finally got to sample their sushi. I have some Unagi (BBQ'ed Eel) and some Ebi (Cooked shrimp with some vinegar). I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful! The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it, and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it. The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any meal.\n\nThe atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant. it is closed off by some sliding doors. It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit.  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to it.\n\nThe Staff is always friendly and kind, and you really could not ask for any better. They always feel very attentive to their customers. If your glass of tea is nearly empty, someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill it.\n\nMusashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina. It is a shame it is so far away from me, but it's worth the trip when I am in the area. if you are looking for some fantastic sushi, tempura, or ramen, this is the place to go!",

I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.\n\nWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.\n\nThe lady wasn't so friendly but I don't mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu. \n\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.\n\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \n\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again. Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food. But definitely no sushi at Musashi. I just want to say that just because it's owned by Japanese don't automatically assume that it'll be good.",

I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menu.\n\nPros:\n\n- The food here is authentic.  I am not Japanese, but this restaurant's dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting Osaka/Tokyo.  As far as I know, this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soups.\n-It seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce.  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores.  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise. \n-Service was good, and food came out very quickly.  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizer.\n-Price is reasonable, perhaps a touch high.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-The restaurant space is cramped.  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can.  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining.  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangement/floorplan.\n-The restrooms are single person restrooms.  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky, presumably from spilled food/drink.\n-The portion sizes are not consistent.  The tempura appetizer(notably no onion rings) was about 7-8 small vegetables, which I consider to be small.  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic, containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides.  My ramen was just the right size.",

We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic (and awesome).\n\nThe service was a little slow and disorganized, so that's the only reason I can't give Musashi 5 stars.

Just because the guy is a Japanese, doesn't make him any kind of sushi master. It's a profession, not a nationality. He also was very slow in making his sushis. I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter. Not only he doesn't seem like a proper sushi cook, his work-attitude was not professional at all. They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customers.",

There were people behind us waiting for a table.. some left.\n\nFood -\n- Tonkotsu Ramen: I was craving for some ramen, and the ramen I had ordered was alright. I was hoping for the one I had tried in NewYork or the one in Houston.  The flavor of the pork Tonkotsu Ramen was there, but just missed the mark on presentation and other ingredients. Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte. \n- Tonkatsu Bento Box: My friend's husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box. \n- Katsu Chicken Entree: My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright.  \n- Salad: The salad ginger peanut dressing was good.\n- Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll: Just shrimp tempura and the roll.. no.. other veggies - what?!\n\nService - They are good about getting to you, when you ask for their service..  When they are busy, it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to you.\n\nPrice - Was alright, not too shabby, and reasonable at best. \n\nSo bottom line, I like the food... but I am in no dire need to come back.

Everything was good, but I wasn't blown away. I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time, but it has a sesame dressing. I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese!! That speaks volumes...  FYI he loved the place but didn't think his chicken was the best.

Fresh and generously sliced sashimi, lightly breaded tempura done right [not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp], flavorful ramen and noodles, and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes, including the light miso-based salad dressing! We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish, but wonderfully prepared nevertheless]. None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not too salty. As a result, you could actually taste the food...what a concept!",

          "Well, here goes my first review to chronicle my life-long love affair with food. I had in mind trying something new because how awfully long some reviews turn out to be - kinda like the length of this introduction. So, bottomline, I'm going to begin with a five words or less review. \n\nAuthentic. Attentive. Explore the appetizers.\n\nThis place fills me with nostalgia. The menu selection and execution remind me of my mom's dishes and the local mom & pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of Japan.\n\nYou won't get a show with your teppan yaki, but what you will get is authentic, and delicious Japanese food. \n\nIf you are looking to get past the more well known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food, I'd recommend the agedashi dofu, grilled mackerel (get a side of rice with it), and nabe udon. \n\nAll in all after three times here, I've left with a feeling of happiness - due to some part of not having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market - that hasn't surfaced in quite some time, even back home in Long Beach, CA.\n\nThe only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen. The broth needs some work. \n\n5 stars.",

          "Musashi holds a special place in my heart and I can't believe I haven't blown up their yelp page with my review! This restaurant is family-owned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill, no fancy chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. \n\nSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous, I recommend the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly, they ran out on this occasion. We've also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we're some adventurous eaters!\n\nNow.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you're not much of a pork fan, I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\n\nBefore I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect meal!",

Our server was very attentive and helpful. Absolutely no complaint about service here!\n\n We have been here twice. The first time, we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer. The gyoza were perfect - served with a chile oil and soy sauce. The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms, half an egg, three pieces of pork that were very tender, a piece of fish cake, and noodles with a lovely chewy texture. The broth tasted of every one of those things - a warm, inviting flavor. \n\nThe second visit, I got the tonkatsu ramen again, while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box. Her box came with a whole tonkatsu, 4pc. California roll, 2 shrimp tempora, 4 pc. vegetable tempora, a seaweed salad, miso soup, a small salad, a shrimp dumpling, a pork dumpling, and an egg roll. Needless to say, we had enough food for lunch the next day. Those two meals, plus sweetened tea for two, came to almost 42.00. For the atmosphere, the friendly service, and the authentic food, I can't wait to go back and try the river eel over rice! Please don't pass this one by!",

I'm not a sushi fan, but I can eat teriyaki chicken and veggies anywhere.  He said he hadn't been in years and was curious to see if they were still as awesome as he remembered.  They were.  He got 4 or 5 different types of rolls and all were good, but he said octopus is one of the best tests of sushi.  He said it was a smidgen chewy, but it's octopus.  The teriyaki chicken was good, but it came with soup, salad and egg salad... no grilled veggies like I'm used to.  It was tasty though.  \n\nOur young waiter was super nice and accommodating (this Asian food nerd needed a fork), and he even bowed to say thank you when we left.  I would've never tried this place without the fella's suggestion since it's in a strip mall and the sign wasn't even lit when we got there, but it was very warm, inviting and unassuming with great food.",

I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.",

A busy spot and a small restaurant.  It did not appear that they took reservations; I'm not sure.  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six.  Dress in layers; this tiny joint gets cozy.\n\nWe plan to try more sushi varieties; it's right in line with prices from other places.  It's very fresh, straightforward presentation.  Timing on food coming out is decent; we didn't wait forever.  We had a couple of rolls and they were good.  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive.  My $11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting.  Next time I will probably try a bento box.

(The Ikura can say a lot about a place.. it should be wet and firm, so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth.  If they are sticky, deflated, over-salted and mushy, they are no good, and the pace probably isn't either.) \n\nMy brother got the pork ramen soup and said it was the worst he has ever eaten.. the noodles were pasty, the broth had WAY too much salt, etc.  He said it was worse than the packaged stuff.\n\nThe place was also dirty, especially the bathrooms.\n\nIt was a horrible experience in almost every way a place can be horrible.

No.\n\nRanting aside, Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen I've had since leaving Japan. Period. The wife's à la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces - the effort they put in really makes the difference. \n\nI've seen another review here on Yelp and I'll echo it here - you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate.  Don't knock them on service without understanding the culture. \n\nI'll end the review with this: if you think Hibachi is Japanese food, then Musashi may not be for you; however, if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style, then look no further.",

          "I finally found some legitimate tonkotsu ramen in Charlotte! It wasn't bland or watery and the pork (chashu?) was savory and delicious. I would definitely come back, though it is a little far out from the city (20 min drive).\n\nYou'll notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home. There's a private dining room, which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats, sliding doors and pillows.The owners are also japanese, which is always a good sign in my books if you're looking for some lip-smacking ramen. \n\nThe menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan, ranging from potato croquettes (with the delicious bulldog brand sauce) to gyoza and even mini fried crabs. Ramen is by far, the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths, soy, miso, tonkotsu etc.\n\nThe process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect. I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almost-creamy texture of the broth, filled with the rich flavor of pork. The soup also has a great milky-color. Unfortunately the noodles aren't hand made and you can tell they're more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles. However, this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl. I didn't leave one drop!\n\nThe restaurant serves alcohol, but not past a certain hour (like 9 or 10), so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki. Perfect accompaniment to dinner. Prices are very reasonable and the hospitality is fantastic. Food is served in a timely fashion and everything tastes phenomenal. \n\nI'm already looking forward to the next time I come back!\n\n4/5",

          "This restaurant seems actually run by Japanese people, which is rare for a Japanese restaurant in the US. It also seems to receive a good number of Japanese regulars, which is always a good sign. I see they're trying to be authentic in their food (I lived in Japan, and I can tell). \n\nAnyway, the ramen I tried, I guess you just can't make it as good as you'd get in Japan. It is pretty ordinary ramen (stuff you could make with the material you gather from an asian market without much efforts), but pricey, (not as meh and pricy as the ones I tried in St. Mark's Place in NYC though, those were absolute rip-offs and were literally cup-noodles in bowls!). \n\nThe lunch sushi plate I didn't try but I saw a sample display at the entrance --- the usual cheapie American style sushi, i.e. a bunch of makis (easy to make a bunch, easier to cheat the flavor of lower quality sashimi, not accidentally never ever seen served in restaurants in japan), fake crab meats (seriously, why would any supposedly \"authentic\" japanese restaurant serve this crap? Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive?), etc.\n\nOK food. Really, not much better (but certainly not worse) than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and the prices were OK. The Japanese regulars seems to frequent the place because they know it cannot get any better in Charlotte as far as Japanese cuisine goes (not because the food there is as good as they'd get back home). So what can you do?",

          "Today I had an absolutely horrible experience at Musashi Japanese restaurant on Johnston Road, Charlotte.\nWaitress were impolite, unfriendly wearing some dirty shoes which should be already a red flag sign, but I was hungry, and I thought \"not a big deal\". Well, it turned out to be a big deal.\nWhere are the traditional appropriate for any type of services smiles? Where is the traditional Japanese hospitality you see in other restaurants? It was anything like that!!!\n When a hostess found out that I am alone she set me at the small uncomfortable table while the restaurant was nearly empty. \nI asked to be seated at another table, and hostess started arguing. I repeat, the restaurant was nearly empty, and who says, if you come alone you don't deserve a better seat?\nI looked at the menu, and asked questions about some dishes, but waitresses did not speak English, and they could not explain me anything.\nI ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI. The dish looked very unattractive: big chunks of lettuce, and  potato salad which I did not order, and nobody asked me, if I want one on a side; the taste was even worse!!! I ate CHICKEN TERIYAKI in many other Japanese restaurants before, and this is a delicious dish, but not in this terrible place.\nOn the top of that I saw a bug crawling across the table. I killed it, and I called a manager. Waitress started arguing with me again!! \nI did not see any smiles, and I did not hear \"I'm sorry\". Waitress/hostess was rude.\nI felt sick after that ordeal.\nI could not touch my meal, and I left this nasty, bugs infested place hungry, and frustrated about a horrible experience, and my wasted time.\n\nI would rate this place the worst rating.",

          "I acquired a taste for Japanese food during my frequent business trips to South East Asia and Japan. In India, it is impossible to find good Japanese food without paying eye-popping prices. When I moved to the US in 2009, I'd expected to be much better off. Columbia, SC where I worked was not exactly the big city I'd hoped to live in and dining options were very limited. So Charlotte is where I ventured for some variety.\n\nMusashi is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I used to stop by here every time I drive through Charlotte or would come to the Charlotte airport to pick up my girlfriend. I moved to Charlotte in 2010 and thought that I'd be a regular visitor after that. The 10-11 mile drive from uptown where I stay meant that I actually visited them even less frequently than when I lived in Columbia.\n\nI'd say that the Sushi has gotten better here from what I remember from my 1st visit in 2009. But the real treats here are the Ramen (love the Tonkatsu Ramen) and the Japanese menu (my faves are the Fish Liver and the Beef & Tofu). Ingredients are top-notch. For example, just try the fried squid - perfectly cooked and the best quality that I've had anywhere including Singapore. \n\nMy girlfriend had been very relucatant to try Japanese food because she was always worried about using chopsticks. One visit to Ippudo NYC convinced her that she needed to eat more Japanese food. We went to Musashi twice this weekend when she flew down to visit me :-) Sat lunch and Sun dinner! So now she is a convert too!\n\nIt is not cheap. But I'd say that it is great value for money - you do get more than what you pay for! Excellent service, nice traditional kind of ambience that is way more than the outside strip mall exterior might suggest. And most of all, fantastic food that I will miss when I move from Charlotte in April :-(",

          "If you go for lunch, I recommend getting either A or B. They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out. It is such a good deal, you only pay about 8 bucks for either box. The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi, 6 regular rolls, 2 larger ones, 2 slices of sashimi on rice, some kind of mayo based salad, miso soup, and peanut sauce salad. Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup, although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.\n     For dinner, I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle. It is awesome, it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful. You cannot take this to go, so be sure to finish it. It has egg and lots of vegetables, and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies. The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good, but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion. Other things I enjoy are the pork katsu-don, ramen, curry katsu, and the agedashi dofu is excellent. Really, no matter what you pick, you can't go wrong. \n    On a rare occasion, most likely in the winter, be sure to check out the sushi specials. If they have TORO tuna(fatty tuna), be sure to get it without any questions, and do not get the roll, just get the whole slab. Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth. Worth every penny.\n    Overall, Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices, Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner. It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place. But when the food is that good, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't have any of the over-the-top sushi roll specials, but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly cooked rice. It is the most authentic Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come across.",

Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.",

          "FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing.",

Except for the Sushi. The only Sushi I've liked here is the Ikura. Of course, they have some rolls on the menu for the Gaijin ;-) which made me sceptical when I first visited. But a quick \"Sumimasen\" did the trick and I got good advice on what is best on the menu. Got chided on my 2nd visit for drinking Sake for lunch but explained that my friend had never had tried it. They were most welcoming of me when I came on my own and I was most embarrassed (and ignored by them) when I visited this place with my girlfriend - because she is exactly the sort of Gaijin who'd insist on ordering Sushi rolls and ignore their wonderful Tonkatsu rameen.\n\nSo to cut it short, this is a place only if you like genuine Japanese, hole-in-the-wall kind of places. If you are looking strictly for Sushi, I'd still recommend the Tamago and the Ikura over any other place within 100 miles.",

If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not be the restaurant for you. \n\nJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner's especially, are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.\n\nThe food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.\n\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten \"brown wasabe\" or fish that I didn't know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\n\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi's great food. If great service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.",

It tasted like wasabi, but why the hell was it brown? We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi.  The kimchi was very spicy, but good.  The pork was a bit tough.  \n\nThey have a whole list of special appetizers, but only about 4 were translated into english.  My girlfriend asked for more translation, but the waiter told us we really wouldn't be interested in them, so we dropped the conversation on it. \n\nMy gut tells me this place has very good, and very authentic Japanese food, but I am not experienced enough in non-sushi Japanese food.  \n\nOn to the sushi:  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp.  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place.  \n\nMusashi has a very small sushi menu.  There are few rolls to choose from, and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri.  \n\nWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.  The fish was cut rather sloppily, and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon.  The salmon was all pink, no typical white-fat lines....  why?\n\nThe rolls come in pieces of 3, which I find weird.  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces.  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up, as the rice was cold and solid - not like sushi rolled right in front of you. \n\nWe have not been back.  If you're looking for really, really, really authentic Japanese food, I would head here and try.  if you're looking for a great sushi experience, I would try other places in the area.",

I think it's the most legit Japanese in Charlotte (primarily because the place is dominated by Japanese patrons).\n\nAgedashi Tofu - broth is to die for and the tofu so  delicately breaded\nSea Snails - one again, boiled/steamed in sake and the shells put out a delicious broth on their own. Texture similar to conch.\nDumplings - I usually don't love dumplings in Japanese restaurants, but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an order.\n\nSushi/Sashimi is outstanding - they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonable.\nSoba/Udon - delicious noodles and clear or dark broth...haven't tried the cold Soba, but that's my next step. \n\nThere is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu, and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that non-Gaijin menu!!

There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions. \n\nThe greeting was all smiles. The service wasn't fast, but not too slow either.

          "I just came back from living in Japan for two years, and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to. Not only that, but the prices aren't too bad either. I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue, my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).\n\nThe atmosphere is nothing special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally, I'd rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant, so I didn't mind at all.\n\nAll-in-all, I think I'll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.\n\nThe key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good sign!",

          "With Musashi, as with other places I enjoy, its all about the food. I don't need a greeter with a plastered smile, or somebody doting on me every 15 seconds. If I have to wait 15 minutes for a table at Musashi, that's fine, cause I know the food more than makes up for it.\n\nThat said, I know this place is hit or miss. My sister and I absolutely loved the place, as did my Japanese roommates (always ALWAYS a good sign that your Japanese roommates love the same Japanese restaurant you do.) But, my brother and sister-in-law weren't too impressed. I think Musashi is good, solid Japanese food. Nothing too fancy. What they did they did well. Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured. Light, crisp, with a flavorful, but not too salty, sauce. The katsudon is how it should be, hot, eggy, with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice. There is also a special Japanese menu, with \"snacks\" which make great accompaniments to beer and sake, or if you're in the mood for \"tapas\". I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue. There's also an excellent sukiyaki. The lunchtime bento boxes were also very good.\n\nYou gotta understand. When you're living in Charlotte, there's not much in the way of Japanese food. And when you've been to Japan three or four times, you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls. That's where Musashi comes in. They've got more than just the same standard sushi, udon, teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US. And they don't try to get too fancy. \n\nAnd try to remember, its all about the food. Not about the lines, not the lack of greeting when you enter, not the crazy eyed lady who doesn't call you \"honey.\" It's the food.",

So are their bento boxes, I'll usually order their grilled mackerel.  And yes, their sushi is also really good.

          "*I have given up on Japanese food in Charlotte*\n\nAny restaurant that fails to acknowledge the customer for over 5 minutes is never going to be good in my book. Musashi makes it easy by serving average food to go with their incredibly crappy service.\n\nWe came in the door and waited by the register for over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us. The place is pretty small so its not like they couldn't see us. The sushi chefs kept looking at us but never moved a muscle to signal the waitresses that we were waiting.\nAfter we sat down, we ordered beer which arrived soon but after that the service was back to crap. \n\nWe ordered tamago sushi which never arrived and we had to ask another waitress to get it because our original waitress simply stopped attending tables. The tamago was quite good. \n\nI got the Udon which was basically chicken broth and noodles with a little green onions sprinkled on it. A monkey can be more creative than that and I certainly did not enjoy paying $9 for it. It had no taste, no spices, not even any soy sauce in it. It was literally broth and noodles. I showered it with their chilli flakes so I could trick myself into thinking it was eatable.\n\nOh and the service wasn't bad for all customers - these two Japanese guys came in and the wait staff fell over each other trying to please them. Every other table was being ignored but these two basically got personal slaves to take care of them. They never had to ask for anything, the waitress was hovering over their table every 3 minutes. \n\nThe service pissed me off and I would never go back even though their sushi is pretty good.",

They don't answer their phone any time of day and don't return calls so it's nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement.  \n\nBut it's a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4.  That's probably their focal point anyway.  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad, if expensive, sake selection.  \n\nI would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier.  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time, so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway.  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or more.",

          "This place has the unfortunate distinction of serving up the worst toro I've ever had--instead of butter, I got coal.  That aside, the sashimi is serviceable and generally as fresh as Charlotte gets.  The specials will almost always be a fantastic deal. You will always have two options to choose from--and while people may hold subconscious grudges against the letter B, I can assure you that electing special B will not detract from your dining experience whatsoever.  My parents and sister love the mackerel here, if that's your thing; I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers.  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer, Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba. \n\nI also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly.  Like Kabernet Sabigny-kind of weird.  That was sort of endearing.\n\nOf course, it's plagued by the same service problems and dour server expressions that other Asian restaurants have, which still can be a bit of a shock in the land of sunshine and Southern hospitality.",

At least three times during the morning, you will get to hear Carlos Diaz's Extra Entertainment Report, where he will indeed give you the most updated celeb gossip...with commentary of course from the peanut gallery (i.e. Chet, Spence, and Lauren). I find the background comments most amusing, because you have to listen hard to pick up on the humor, but once you do, you are cracking up in the shower or in the car on the way to work. There is also Gary Spivey, the psychic, who appears on the show once a week, and takes calls from the viewers. Then there's Group Therapy, where they will answer a relationship question of the week. The crew also has random contests and questions they'll throw out at the listeners, asking them to call in. The morning phone scams are hilarious as well.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm so obsessed with this show, I friended the radio station and Chet Buchanan on myspace! Maybe one day I'll get to meet them. :)",

It wasn't quite dinner-time, so we thought that we'd share a paella, wander around some more, the get the real dinner.\n\nWhen we entered the completely empty restaurant, there was a dude, clearly a staff, chilling in the corner. He ignored us, we stood awkwardly for about 5 minutes, when another dude (probably the owner) came out of the kitchen, and directed us to a table.\n\nWe asked him how big a typical paella was. He indicated with his hands, \"Pretty big.\" So we ordered one paella and one appetizer to share. Then he told us that actually, no, the paellas are very small, and we would never be full with just one paella. We told him that it was just a snack (pointing out that it was barely 4pm). Then he told us that the paella that we chose wasn't as good as this other paella that he would like to recommend to us. He of course pointed to the most expensive paella on the menu, but oh boy, were we onto you!\n\nWe declined his recommendation, at which point he continued to press various other appetizers on us. We declined all of them (go us!), at which point he sulked into the kitchen.\n\nThe bread that came with the meal was cold and greasy, the appetizer (garlic shrimp) was pretty good, but then the paella was disastrous. The mussels in the paella weren't cleaned properly, and I could see the beard hanging off of them. Gross! The flavours were so bland and we were both disappointed. We ended up leaving more than half the food on the \"tiny\" paella. When we were done, the owner-dude came with a big fake condescending smile, asking if we would like the dessert, and that he would give it to us for free.\n\nThere was something very untrustworthy about it, so we declined, paid and got out of there as soon as possible. That was definitely new but not an experience that I'd like to repeat!",

All in all, I would definitely consider returning for more!\n\nThe 3 paella's easily fed all 5 of us and we split 3 desserts (chocolate mousse, fruit salad, and coffee cake) with ample satisfaction.\n\nThey have flamenco dancing (on a small stage in the restaurant) each Saturday (possibly Sunday) and accept American Express, as well as other credit cards.  \n\nA welcome change to the standard rotation of various restaurants available in the area, this cozy nook is definitely worth the trip!",

I decided that the downside of changing the shutter around was not worth the consequences so I declined the service.\n\nHeath was very knowledgeable and very honest!!! At the time I booked the appointment it was my understanding that there was a service call fee. Heath did not even charge me a service call fee, but I insisted on giving him something for his time and diagnosis.

Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts.

One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.\n\nFran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an \"i\" not an \"l\") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.\n\nOverall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee.

          "Perched on a bluff overlooking Interstate 77 and the Cleveland skyline, Harry's reminds me of the classic steakhouses of yesteryear, like the old Sizzler back in the 1980's: weathered, rustic wood paneling and saloon-style chandeliers abound, along with an open kitchen setup that allows for tantalizing whiffs of grilling meat and flashes of flame as the chefs serviced a typical Saturday night crowd. \n\nBooths and tables are big, with plenty of room for drinks and sides, with butcher paper table covers and crayons for any toddlers in-tow at this kid-friendly restaurant.  The menu is expansive, with plenty of pork, poultry and seafood entrees, in addition to their sizable selection of steaks...surely something to please everyone. We started with a nicely-portioned appetizer of potato skins. Hot, generously-filled and chock full of bacon and cheddar, they were the perfect start to our meal.\n\nDinners include an iceberg salad, which was a bit of a downgrade for a steakhouse...throw in some romaine and mixed greens, please, and quit treating salad as an afterthought.  The rolls were similarly subpar; soft and doughy, reminiscent of the old Parker House rolls...although I imagine many patrons will enjoy them immensely.  I should mention that the salad is served \"family-style\" in a large bowl and set of tongs, with Olive Garden-style unlimited refills.\n\nMy husband ordered the 22oz. Porterhouse, with a generous, piping hot Idaho potato as his starch.  I selected the Mahi Mahi, which was grilled nicely and served atop a typical bed of rice pilaf. I would have loved to have tried the accompanying mango chutney, but unfortunately the kitchen was out of stock as we were dining rather late in the evening. Nonetheless, our dinners were fairly enjoyable and served efficiently and pleasantly.\n\nHarry's also has banquet facilities, in addition to an attached full liquor bar and patio.  Respectable steak, served in mildly retro surroundings, with hospitality and generous portions.  They also offer daily specials and special seasonal offerings including their ever-popular autumnal clam bake.",

My friend had one and she agreed with that assessment. \nSalad:\nServed family style, mixed greens, onion, croutons, cheese, pepperonici and Italian salad dressing. Pretty good. \nThe meat: \nSplit the 22 ounce delmomico which was probably half bone. Meat was grilled to a perfect medium, and had a nice grill marks and was well seasoned. Split this with someone as I was not in the mood for that much. It was actually perfect amount of meat. Oh there was very little waste as well. \n\nSides\nI requested the veg of the day and it was a medley of broccoli, carrots, and green beans. Decent but nothing special. Also ordered the sautéd onions and shrooms, they were excellent. Friend had a sweet potato the size of my frigging head.  Many people had the mashed potatoes, they looked pretty spectacular. \nThat staff was  effecient and friendly.\nOverall this was decent for the price point.

          "Unfortunately I didn't quite enjoy Harry's after my boyfriend requested we come here  for his birthday. \n\nThe food quality is average at best. The steak had an odd taste to it I could not put my finger on as to the cause. I suspect it was the marinade they used, as it had a slightly astringent/alcohol taste. Perhaps too much Worcestershire? The cinnamon \"butter\" was good, but would have been better with hearty, homemade bread rather than overly processed dinner rolls that, although were hot and baked per order, tasted artificial and empty. The scalloped potato dish was decent; however, it lacked salt. While I appreciated the \"bottomless salad\", I specifically asked our server what in included ingredient wise, and after omitting the ingredients my boyfriend and I didn't want on our salad, it came back with cheese (which the server failed to mention the salad included in it). It wasn't a big deal, because although I don't prefer cheese on my salad, I don't have an allergy or aversion to cheese so I just said \"oh well!\" and ate it anyway. Not very knowledgeable on the servers part, however. \n\nAlthough the service was polite and friendly, it was nearly nonexistent. Huge lags in time were observed throughout each step in our dinner. From getting greeted, to placing our order, to receiving our check. At first, I suspected our server was just busy with another large table in the other room that we weren't seeing. I was correct, as she apologized for taking some time to greet us and get drinks in as she was \"cashing out a large party.\" But after that, the service remained slow despite the restaurant only having two other tables at the time. I observed another table getting upset at (what I agree with) was a very long time to wait to get their food orders in. They finally flagged down the server, and in a slightly irritated tone said \"we've been ready!\" And the server said back in an uncomfortable exchange, \"All you had to do was ask! I thought you were waiting for another person!\" (Honest mistake, but having serving experience, one should never assume because the server wrongly assumed and the party could have had their meals in.) On a side note, that had no bearing on my star value, can we stop having servers write their name on the table? It's just a little cheesy and totally detracts from a classier steakhouse experience.\n\nOverall I can't say I'll be back to Harry's or even comfortably recommend it. Perhaps with some changes in food quality and service Harry's can improve.",

          "We were going to try a steakhouse up in Cleveland for Restaurant Week, but I saw a couple reviews stating that this place was better, for half the price. So we were pretty excited to try this place out. I would say overall, we were a little underwhelmed. \n\nWe walked in around 8:30pm and were worried about the wait, because the placed looked packed. We actually got seated and got our drink order placed within 5 minutes though. We decided to order an appetizer of Mozzarella sticks and received those and our salad within 10 minutes of sitting down. We were pretty impressed. We placed our orders and tried the sticks. I thought they tasted like they were the kind you find in the frozen food aisle at GFS, but they weren't awful. Rolls were warm and fresh from the oven with regular and cinnamon butter. Honestly, our food didn't take too long to come out, even with a packed house. I will point out however, that I asked for a baked potato and had to go with the mashed, because the wait for the baked potato was over a half-hour. I was happy that the waitress let me know, but still kind of disappointed. I also heard another waitress tell a table beside us that they are running out of everything tonight and he can't have something replaced. Thought that was a little weird. I get that it's Saturday night, but you are a steakhouse... Our steaks were kind of a disappointment. Neither seemed to have any flavor and the sirloin was really really tough. I had asked for medium and it came out a LOT more pink than expected. \n\nThe staff was nice and the food came out really quick. I wish it all had more flavoring, but that's not a make-or-break for me. I don't think we will be coming back here for steak, but I'm sure we'll try it again someday for lunch.",

I had heard good things so I was excited to try it and I gotta say I was not that impressed. It wasn't the worst but certainly wasn't anywhere near the best. I just went with the 8 oz sirloin. It was a little on the tough/well done side and I asked for medium well. The seasoning was not impressive, seemed like it was seasoned it just pepper. \n\nThe French onion soup was pretty good. But I would be more inclined to go somewhere else to try a bowl or somewhere I've been and have liked their soup. \n\nOverall, I am in no hurry to return but that's not to say I would never.",

Harry's prices are a fraction of what a person would pay at those places .. my friend and I had the $16.99 dinners which included two dinners .. I had chicken stir fry which was quite good .. my friend had top sirloin which she said was also good .. it was a fairly small steak of good quality ...for the price we weren't expecting a huge steak .. each entree came with a side salad which was crisp and delicious and we ordered a side of Potatoes Au Gratin which at $2.99 was an amazing deal .. I haven't had potatoes au gratin since I was a kid . I'll go back to Harry's if for no other reason than the potatoes ... I noticed one reviewer was unhappy she had to pay for drinks .. and the $2.50 for a bottle of spring water .. I highly recommend Harry's for people who want comfort food at very low prices ..surpassed what I would have expected ...\nBy the way , there really is a Harry and he made the rounds going to each table and asking about our meals .. that in itself was impressive",

          "$2.50 for a glass of water ... sirloin was tenderized by beating\nMy wife and I went for late lunch/early dinner in September. There were several early bird specials for just under $17 for two meals. The banner on the front of the building failed to mention that two drink orders were required. We promptly seated. Decore was a bit on the dark side. Waiter was friendly and prompt. I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a glass of water. I was told not to worry that we did not have the second required drink order but I went ahead and ordered my wife a Margarita. Salads were fresh and promptly served. Meals were fresh and hot. My wife's water with a lemon in it cost $2.50. My steak was not bad but had been obviously tenderized via pounding. The seats in the booth were in dire need of repair as the springs were sagging so one basically was sitting on boards. we may venture back to try the burger specials in the bar area and NOT order that apparently exclusive and expensive \"Ponce de León fountain of youth\" water again.",

The menu isn't extensive, but you could always count on good food and friendly service - that was until our most recent visit on 08/08/2017.\n\nOur server was most unpleasant.  She rushed us through the dining experience from the get-go.  We had to tell her that we were ordering appetizers and then she immediately asked for our entree orders.  To my surprise, everyone was ready except for their choice of sides which irritated the server.  She never asked anyone if they wanted refills on any drinks throughout dinner.  She asked us to hand her dishes multiple times and she acted overall like we were inconveniencing her the entire time.  I looked for the manager or the hostess on the way out to complain, but they were nowhere to be found.  \n\nI was disappointed with my steak as well.  I ordered a rib-eye steak cooked medium-rare.  It was more like medium-well with absolutely no outside char for texture which makes for a mushy steak.  \n\nWith so many choices these days, I don't think I'll go back to Harry's.",

          "After a reluctant second chance I am glad I tried this place! \n\nI have to say that I had to REALLY give this place a chance or second chance rather because my first time dealing with this restaurant was unappealing.  \n\nI had called during the week for their dinner two for $16.49.  I understood their was a window of time for this deal; Monday thru Friday 3:30 pm - 6:00 pm.  This appeals to the working class, 9 am-5 pm employees and the mature middle aged group of men and women who still have dinner at a decent time instead of other establishments who serve dinner \"specials\" from 6-9 or even until closing.  Going back to my first experience here, I admit, here and now, that I made the mistake of calling at 5:55 pm.  By the time I finally got through to someone after being on hold it was just after 6 pm so I was hoping for leniency and generosity on this potential order.  I did not have such luck and what was even MORE unsettling was that fact that the server first implied that the 2 dinners for $16.49 was ONLY A DINE IN OPTION??  I did not see that mentioned or listed anywhere.  In fact, if you look on their website it is EXTREMELY misleading that they mention and list on their website in BIG, bold red letters \"Harry's 2 Go!\" followed by their phone number to call them and order.  This is then followed by, in the same big red font, \"2 Dinners for $16.49\".  I was upset by this statement.  When I first called I had spoken to an employee and asked, \"I know it's late but can I still order the 2 Dinners for $16.49?\".  This first employee said, \"Yes, I we can still do that for you. Please hold and someone will take your order.\"  They proceeded to put me on hold while someone picked up the line.  A second employee picked up the line and already did not sound happy from the start.  I asked him about the \"2 Dinners for $16.49\".  He immediately replied, \"It's after 6, this deal has passed today but that deal is Dine-In only.\"  This confused me and I was thrown back because there was no indication of this being Dine-In only.  I told him, \"The first employee I spoke to said you could still do the deal since I called before 6 pm and I didn't know it was Dine-In only.\"  This employee became very blunt and said, \"Well, I'll talk to this employee but I guess I can give it to you this time if the computer will let me.\"  There was NO need for him to be condescending for any reason.  A few seconds later he replied, \"No, the computer will not let me do it anyway.\"  I was so put off by this behavior that I just replied okay and hung up.  \n\nThis whole experience really had me contemplate ever trying them again.  I can honestly say that on this day the ONLY two reasons I tried them were, ONE: I had a coupon and TWO: The coupon made Harry's Steakhouse cheaper than Outback Steakhouse.  What is disappointing about ordering from Harry's is that you can ONLY order over the phone, there is NO online ordering feature.  I still decided to try it.  Between my roommate and myself we ordered the 16 oz. Ribeye, and the 1/2 slab of ribs with chicken dinner along with two 'crocks' of French Onion soup.  Each dinner came with one side (we both ordered the mashed potatoes) and (this impressed me the most) a FULL size salad! I mean a 9\"x 9\" Styrofoam container full of salad.   With my coupon our WHOLE meal came out to $49 and some change!  It may sound like a lot to pay for dinner on a Sunday night but picture this: Two plastic grocery bags filled to the top on each of them with food!  5 large Styrofoam containers filled with food.  2 LARGE main courses, 2 large salads and 1 container for about half a dozen rolls with butter and cinnamon butter. Plus 2 round 8 oz. containers containing French Onion soup and then 2 more 8 oz. containers containing mashed potatoes.  \n\nUpon arrival I had to wait in the lobby because I had no idea where to go for take-out and there were no signs.  When the hostess greeted me, I said I ordered take-out.  She told me to go sit at the bar. REALLY?? For take-out?  This was unusual to me and on a Sunday evening (after the Browns lost again) the bar was filled with middle-aged men and women who had more than a few drinks so finding just a place to sit at the bar was hard.\n\nThe food made ALL of this a positive experience that I was able to look past the previous service.  My roommates steak was an excellent piece of rib eye, My ribs were tender but my chicken was slightly dry in the outside but juicier towards the center.  The mashed potatoes were AMAZING.  They are REAL potatoes with small pieces of the skin in them (if you like that though) and added some flavor with a lot of salt like some I've had in the past.  To top it off they do have one of the BEST French Onion soups I've had anywhere and will DEFINITELY be trying that again!  \n\nOverall, the food did overshadow the service in this case.  I would recommend this steakhouse to anyone to give a chance to with the hope of having a similar food quality with BETTER service",

          "After reading a few reviews mentioning good prime rib, I decided to try Harry's Steakhouse as I didn't feel like venturing too far from the hotel. What a bad choice!! It started with the long wait to get service. Once a waitress finally came by, I was told happy hour only in bar area although I was seated at table in the bar. I then ordered a medium rare prime rib with a side of coconut shrimp. The entree came out before my dinner rolls and soup. I was disappointed that my prime rib looked more well done than medium. The shrimp was okay while the marmalade sauce was entirely too sweet. Never have I wanted to leave leftovers.",

Everyone ordered steak except for me, who loves chicken, mushrooms, and onions.  I ordered a side of veggies too.  We were served bread and a large bowl of salad, which was really good.  The restaurant is really large and they were very busy, but they still brought our food pretty quickly.\n\nMy chicken was very tasty as were the shrooms and onions.  Also, my steamed veggies were nicely seasoned and they were tasty.  I really liked my meal.  The steaks looked and tasted very good - much better than on our last visit.\n\nI didn't think we'd come back here, but the other steak houses were jam packed on a Friday at 7pm.  We got right in!  I will visit again.",

The potatoes were very good, too.  I've had really greasy au gratin potatoes before but these were really good.   Prices are very reasonable, too.

Great steaks at an affordable price, and better than your neighborhood chains like Longhorn and Outback. \n\nHarry's has an \"old school\" rustic atmosphere similar to Texas Roadhouse. We will sometimes dine here with a party of 10 or more and it's never an issue because they have plenty of seating and full bar area as well. Good selection of menu items raging from apps to sandwiches, steaks, seafood, chicken, & burgers. \n\nPrime rib, Ribeye, and Delmonico Steaks are always tender and delicious. Never had to send something back. Entrees come with \"family\" style all you can eat salad (house dressing fantastic) which is a nice addition along with hot rolls. \n\nLocated in a nice area where you can go out to the bars after or catch a movie at Valley View.",

Family style salad like olive garden with no cheese add chick pea, rolls like Logans Steakhouse soft and sweet. They serve them with regular and cinnamon butter. I preferred regular butter.\n\nWooden booths and red checkered table clothes with white butcher paper made me think 'standard steakhouse'  but the place is huge. Anyway, back to the service. 4 top table, not needy, having to flag down for refills and really had to ask for any need when she came by to check up. Then, once the check was paid, she never came back to clear dirty plates,  or serve drink refills while we chatted for 30 minutes more when they weren't very busy. I saw the tip, it was a full 20% so it wasn't that. \n\nI ordered the chopped steak and it was perfectly fine. I did need A1, but that's pretty typical unless the meat is something stellar. Got the baked potato side- it came unsplit, which I found odd.\nDad got the bacon wrapped filet. Loved it. Brother got the center cut chops and sweet potato. The latter is a good use for that cinnamon butter. Uncle got the lobster tails. He seemed to enjoy them. \n\nWe drove 45 minutes to get to this place and I wouldn't do that again, but for that area it's a good dinner option for those who like steakhouses. Just hope your service is more on their game.",

The meal included a family style salad bowl served at the table, delicious rolls, and a dessert buffet.  By the way, Maria was an outstanding waitress!  We sat in the main dining room and my only complaint was that the restaurant was so full it was difficult navigating between the tables to get to the buffet. All in all, a great experience for a very reasonable price - buffet was $24.95/adult. We will return to sample the regular menu.",

Our waitress, Maja, forgot about us after our last refill. She was efficient until we had to wait 10 minutes, then my date went to get a box for our leftovers because Maja didn't come back. Then Maja rushed over to our table ready to tackle my girl for helping herself to a to-go box. Not quite, but she seemed perturbed.\nSome of the busboys and servers also felt like they had the right of way when they were walking through, even the ones with nothing in their hands. No ' excuse me' or stepping to the side to let a customer through. I understand if they have a tray, but to just walk right in front of you is quite rude.\nWe got our check, which was VERY reasonable considering the amount and quality of food. \nOverall I would definitely go back again.",

They were probably the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant.  Unfortunately, the steak was sub-par.

Well, we've never been to Harry's and I've been wanting to try it so off we went.\n\nUpon arrival, I noticed just how big this place really is.  It has a dedicated bar, which is separate from the restaurant.  As we entered the restaurant, we passed by the bar, which was pretty full of people and humming with chatter.\n\nWe were promptly seated with no call ahead necessary.  This is a large restaurant, so there are plenty of seats available.  Our waitress arrived promptly and took our drink orders.  She was friendly and gave my kids some crayons to draw on the table with.  So my daughter and I took turns drawing stuff, which was fun.\n\nI looked at the menu and it seemed to contain your standard steakhouse fare.  We all wanted steak, so I opted for the 12 oz sirloin.  My wife ordered a 10 oz ribeye and my daughter ordered the bacon wrapped filet.  Then we were served all-you-can-eat salad and warm bread rolls.  After we each polished off a salad, the steaks arrived!\n\nI cut into my steak only to find it over cooked.  I ordered it medium, but it was definitely well-done.  It was brown throughout.  The flavor of the steak was just average.  I wouldn't consider this to be a very flavorful steak.  I was a little surprised because this is a 'steak house' after all.  My wife said her steak was cooked correctly and she would give it a 3 out of 5 stars.  My daughter's filet was also well done, but we ordered it medium well.  It's really not that hard to cook a steak correctly, especially if you have enough sense to use a thermometer.  Shame.  Perhaps they should increase the light level at the grills so the cooks can see the steak.\n\nMy side of veggies was covered with Canadian steak seasoning and was very hot.  Way too much seasoning!  Veggies are simple.  You sautee them in olive oil and you're done.  Am I right?  The French fries were forgettable.\n\nI was hoping this place would be a bit above 3 stars, but it ended up being just a solid three stars due to the food quality/taste/texture/preparation.\n\nThe server was very nice, keeping our drinks topped off.  My favorite flavor of the evening was my glass of Malbec wine.  It was actually really good!  We'll avoid this restaurant in the future in the search for better food.",

We have always received great service (in the dining room or at the bar) and we have yet to leave disappointed.

They also have great burgers, ribs & grilled chicken & shrimp.  If you want a steak night out at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with Harry's.",

          "I had not been to Harry's Steakhouse since the 90's when I went there for prime rib with my family.  I do remember it being very good, but for whatever reason just never made it back there. Everything about this place was awful! After about 10 minutes our server \"Molly\" came to us for our drink order.  She had the personality of a paper towel.  Kind of like one of those experiences where you ask yourself \"Why would this person become a server when you have to cater to the public, both good and bad, and do it all with a smile and for tips?\"  She looked bothered to be there.  Brought out some rolls and salad.  Both were ok, might seem nitpicky to judge rolls and salad, but hey, it is part of the experience.  The rolls seemed weirdly dense with a weird texture.  Definitely had that frozen roll quality, but whatever..........they were passable.  My wife and I both got a variation of prime rib, mine larger and medium, her's medium well.  It is always funny to me how steak doneness is one of the most common mistakes in restaurants that pride themselves in steak!  Mine was rare and not medium rare, just rare.  I actually prefer mine medium rare but have got in the habit of going for the medium because most places can't do medium rare well.  My wife's steak was well done and dry as a bone.  Both steaks were cold, not warm, cold! It appeared as if most of the servers there were more concerned about their sidework than any of the patrons there.  I only saw one guy with a tie, ducking in and out here and there and never once even so much as made eye contact with a customer.  This place was not that full either for a Saturday night at 8 o'clock.  The server offered to replace our steak and I told her not to worry about mine as I personally felt that it was less to do with the temperature and more to do with the flavor. I remember my prime rib from this place having an amazing bark on it.  I won't soon forget it, it was incredible.  This time around, the steaks tasted like they were marinated in water and cooked with zero seasoning.  When the server brought my wife's steak back, it was in fact hot but somehow tough as leather and did not even resemble prime rib.  The server never came back to ask us how everything was until way way later, like where the hell is the check later.  You would have thought she might have pretended to be concerned as she was working for a tip.  Now , I am not one of those a-holes that thinks another human being has to cater to my every whim just because they are a server.  I honestly was just hoping to get one simple thing......... a sincere apology!  When she finally did bring the bill, she said \"he discounted the one steak for you\"  oh by the way my wife ate a grand total of two bites of both steaks.  She was starving when we left.  I just wished I would have had the chance to meet \"he\".  So a manager was aware of the problem and never even bothered to show his face?? Appalling.  My wife and I both concluded that if our server would have just been a little apologetic, it would have went a long way.  AVOID THIS PLACE!!! Below average food, below average service......what else is there\"?",

          "I had driven past Harry's a dozen times on Brecksville Road, and was always curious to check out this restaurant that towers over the road in a place you wouldn't necessarily think of as an ideal restaurant location.\n\nWhen we arrived it was a rainy September evening; we decided to chance heading over without reservations, and even though it was 6:30 PM on a Friday evening, we didn't need them. The place was only about half full, which is still pretty busy, because the restaurant is large.\n\nIt has sort of a dude ranch vibe, with plank floors, rough walls, red checker table cloths, dim lighting, etc. The server was at our table within two minutes of our sitting down and remained pretty attentive throughout the meal.\n\nMy partner started with the French onion soup, a frequent choice of his at different restaurants.  He declared it good, but not incredible; it appeared to be at least partially home made, as the onions in the broth were not cooked down enough, and still had a little crunch to them.  Interestingly, instead of topping it with a slice of bread, they used a number of large croutons, over which they laid the cheese.  it did come out hot and the cheese was nicely melted.\n\nHe ordered the 12 oz. prime rib and I got the 16 oz. T-bone steak. While I didn't order a separate appetizer, both our meals came with salad, which is served family style - sort of like at the Olive Garden - but they give you your dressing in individual cups.  It was a pretty basic iceberg lettuce salad, with cheese, tomatoes, onions, some garbanzos, and maybe one or two other accoutrements.  He ordered the Caesar dressing and on the recommendation of a previous reviewer here, I tried the Italian dressing.  Both were fine, but I certainly didn't find the Italian dressing to be as impressive as the other reviewer indicated.\n\nThe meal also came with a basket of rolls, which were fairly good.  I think they baked them in house, but I couldn't swear to it.  It was a slightly sweet, white bread roll, and they offered both plain and cinnamon butter to go with them. I tried the cinnamon butter, and found it tasted like cinnamon toast - not exactly a taste combination I would have imagined to accompany steak, but I will give them points for trying something different.\n\nBoth of us ordered our entrees to be cooked to a \"medium\" finish, but we both felt that their medium was slightly rarer than we expected. We both agreed that we would have been better off with medium well. \n\nMine came with mashed potatoes that were very underwhelming. They were mashed with the skin on, which is fine, but overall they had a gluey quality and were not as hot as they should have been. He ordered his entree with well done fries, which came out very brown and good looking, but somehow failed to be as crisp as they looked or should have been.\n\nIn total we had 2 soft drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 beef entrees for $60, which included about a 20% tip.  The value seemed reasonable for the service and the quality.   \n\n Would I go far out of my way to eat at Harry's? No. Do I think I'll go back? Most likely. The place is not perfect but it's better than just okay, and they offer an early bird menu of two entrees for $16.99, which I consider to be a bargain for the product and service.",

          "My Girlfriend stumbled upon Harry's Steakhouse while driving home from work one day.  \n\nShe told me about it and I was not certain as I have never heard of it.  \nI thought this was a bad sign but would later be proven wrong.\nWe went later that night, Valentines Day 2011 for a dinner, her treat to me.  \n\nI was nervous upon pulling up and seeing a sign that boasted 2 entrees for 14.99, how could that be any good right?\n\nUpon walking in, it becomes apparent that it is a fairly large establishment and also doubles as a banquet hall and in addition has a separate bar area.\n\nWe were quickly seated and luckily we were on the early side of the Valentine's Day dinner rush!\n\nThe place is pretty rustic and sort of has a country feel to it.  \n\nOur server quickly came by and took our drink and soup orders.\n\nMy gal ordered French Onion soup while I went with side salad.\n\nShortly thereafter we placed our dinner orders.  She wanted Steak tips medium with white potato while I ordered half herb rotisserie chicken with sweet potato.\n\nSoup was quickly brought out as well as salad among or chit chat.\n\nWe were fortunate to be seated by a window which seemed to have a radiator pumping welcomed heat underneath the table.  What's Valentine's Day w/ out a little heat after all anyway?\n\nOur dinners arrive and the order was messed up.  She had a sweet potato and my dinner was chopped steak!  Her meat was also a bit undercooked, but being a Texan, she doesn't mind a little M. Rare from time to time.\n\nI was in shock and did not notify the server until he came back shortly thereafter.\n\nWe explained how my dish was completely wrong; he tried leaving me some garlic mashed potatoes....\n\nHe quickly brought out a sweet potato but no chicken.\n\nMy girlfriend had finished her steak before my plate was even brought out and I nibbled on the remnants of her potato.\n\nWhile all of this was going on of course i pondered how to rate this place.  I teetered between 2 & 3 and well obviously am settling on a 3.  The food was OK.  The price was right...\n\nAnyway...the chicken came out finally and it was a little dry inside although the skin tasted delicious, doesn't all skin really? mmmm\n\nanyway....\n\nI finished the chicken while she watched this time and we decided to try dessert.\n\nShe ordered an Oreo cake but really wanted a chocolate cheese cake; she was disappointed they did not have any....\n\nI on the other hand was told there was cassata cake and by the server and even though I warned him I am Italian, he continued to recommend it.  \n\nthe deserts came....he brought her a chocolate Godiva cheese cake he did not realize they had and pointed out what he did immediately, she stuck with the Godiva chocolate cheese cake! \n\nAnd then the cassata came out.\n\nAll in all not bad.  I love cassata and they had this about right though I still think Rito's bakery is #1 on that note....\n\nI would be willing to try Harrys again and I think we will sooner or later.\n\nIf it goes the same way i may have to downgrade to a 2, but if it goes smooth it's definitely a 3 or even a 4 possibly.\n\nOverall good food good price low hassle :)",

This was my and my husband's first time dining there. \nThe atmosphere is comfortable, classic rough hewn wood, hardwood flooring, and tables/booths a plenty. There were other patrons in business casual attire, we were in jeans and tee shirts and did not feel uncomfortable. \n\nHe ordered one of the burgers (bigger something, forgot the name of it) and I had the full rack of ribs. We started with the bacon and cheese fries which were probably big enough for 4-6 so we took most of it home. My dinner came with a salad and I had the Italian dressing. I HIGHLY recommend the Italian if you like good garlic flavor and some nice savory bite. My husband and I also found it delicious for dipping the freshly baked bread. The bread was also delightful with the cinnamon sugar whipped butter it came with. \nHe couldn't finish his burger which was mouthwateringly juicy and seasoned. The onion rings he had were also wonderful. I ordered the full rack of ribs (for $4 more than the half rack, why not have another meal out of it tomorrow?!) I enjoyed the slightly sweet and exquisitely tangy BBQ sauce with the fall-off-the-bone smokey rib meat. I also took a great deal of my dinner home. We didn't even attempt dessert, maybe next time though. For 2 soft drinks, an appetizer, and 2 dinners the bill came to $47. This will give us at least another meal each tomorrow. \nThe waitress was very friendly and prompt at her service. There were 2 other tables next to us where different servers were friendly and talkative with their customers. \n\nWe will definitely return here, and we will bring friends and family. Unquestionably worth the money.",

They've discontinued my favorite turkey, spinach and egg white on sprouted grain, but the staff went above duty to find a new alternative and favorite - the Mediterranean egg white with basil pesto (not only the menu, so you'd have to ask for it by name). I'm tempted by the endless line up of delicious looking pastries - cookies, muffins, croissants and cakes but I'm not trying to be \"carbie Barbie\" anymore. Panera is a great option for those who are looking for healthy choices, vegetarians, and those who pay attention to nutrition facts. And yes, those who just like good eats! The restaurant is relatively clean, they have a unique selection of refreshments, and is managed mostly by the under 30 crowd (nothing wrong with that, just an observation). Overall, 4 stars for the robust menu and good service!",

Their bakery department is so extensive that an individual must usually buy two pastries to curb the urge. \n\nThe staff was super friendly this morning and always is. Their store is welcoming and warm like an extension of my own kitchen. I ended up with a blueberry muffin and a croissant.  Both pastries were impeccable and fluffy soft. The coffee was drip and very strong that I flavored myself with cream and sugar from there bar. Then sat for about ten minutes enjoyed the muffin and coffee in their dining room for a small moment to myself.",

Today I actually felt frustrated and asked the cashier if it's a normal thing for them to be sold out of the few products they sell so early on in day?  Her response: \"yea on Tuesdays\". On Tuesdays??  Weird response.  Weekends maybe but a random weekday?  I would understand if this was an issue at 3 in the afternoon since they are open ALL DAY but when you have only been open a couple hours and the issue seems to be you are always sold out management needs to seriously rethink the availability they are putting out every day. You guys only sell a few products,  if they are NEVER available when you have just opened for the day your customers will go elsewhere.  I am currently googling other area locations for different businesses with these products and will take my business elsewhere.  \n\nHighly recommend you do not come to this location of you are looking for breakfast food as you may not find it!

I stopped by at about half after 7PM on a Wednesday to no line at the register and 6 employees behind the counter in the prep area; though no one to be found at the registers. More staff was throughout the store, but again, no one available to take a food order. After two minutes at the register (no problem), I was greeted by an employee about 20 feet away and asked to wait, which I patiently did, for another 5 minutes (odd, but still no problem). Eventually it was time to order. Once the order was completed (without error, I may add) it was back to the waiting game. I've been to busy Panera's - ones where you wait 15-20 minutes for food because they have 50+ customers at a time every 15 minutes. However, this is not one of those Paneras - be not mistaken. Regardless, with six people behind the counter in prep it took almost 10 minutes to prepare two pick-twos along with whatever other orders (mobile or otherwise) they were balancing (albeit poorly - now we have a problem). This is certainly not going to be on my list of paneras to visit from here on out, unless of course I'm prudent enough to order online half-an-hour out. Though at that point, I'd rather spend the half hour driving round trip to a more distant location. Thanks anyway, store 4082.",

I always have water with my meals and inadvertently forgot to order a drink for my husband. Being that I had already paid and was still in line, I informed the girl at the counter that I would like to add a fountain drink to my order. She said it was alright and proceeded to hand me two plastic cups for the drinks. She basically gave it to me for free and I thought that was very nice of her. Thanked her and went to find a seat. Not long after, our orders came. I got a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad with a cup of tomato soup. Instead, they brought the tomato soup and what seemed like just salad greens. So I go back to the counter with salad on hand and inform the same girl that there must have been a mistake because I ordered a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad. A lady at the counter, turned out was the manager (this I found out later), said it was the salad I ordered - it was just \"the toppings were missing\": chicken, Fuji apple chips and pecans. I thought that was funny (not) - a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad without apples and chicken. Nevertheless, manager said she was going to bring it over. A freshly made salad came out, with manager personally bringing it and saying she wanted to make sure I get my order right. You'd think that was the end of it. But, no. I flagged down a staff member and informed him that my salad did not have chicken and this is the second time they made a mistake. He apologized and asked if I wanted a new one made. My reply, \"I don't know what you're supposed to do. I just want the salad I ordered.\" He took the salad and was back in no time. It was the same salad which they sprinkled with chicken on top. My husband asked to speak with a manager. She came to our table and immediately said that she yelled at everyone in the kitchen for the mistake. She said they \"check the food\" before it goes out to make sure it's right. My husband was like, \"It's just unbelievable that this could happen twice.\" She replies, \"I know, I know. That's why I yelled at everyone. We're sorry that this happened.\" She offered to give us a treat or some kind of pastry or even a free meal for all the trouble. I wasn't asking  for anything. All I wanted was my salad. I mean, how hard could that be? Someone in the kitchen is clearly not paying attention. Nevertheless, manager gave us the free meal and on our way out, I was going to bring the dishes to the station, she offered to do it for me. Truly appreciate that they tried to correct the mistake. I love Panera and I love the food but... maybe I'll stay away for awhile...",

Rapid pickup orders can be placed online once you create a free account with Panera bread.  Panera bread has a large menu of soups, salads, sandwiches, and flats to choose from that are mid-range in price.  There is a decent sized bakery as well where you can purchase various breads.  Furthermore, they have 4 different types of coffee to choose from, which you can pour yourself and refill while dining in.

Nobody came so after a few minutes we just did it ourselves. They were pretty busy so no big deal.\n\nWe chose the half chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and the Cobb salad. I also added in the sweet corn chowder to share with my girlfriend. The soup was too sweet for my taste. I prefer a more chicken stock based soup with cream/milk and corn. The Cobb was pretty bland but they go light on the dressing which I don't mind. It's nice and healthy. The sandwich was good. Bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You could tell it was freshly baked. \n\nOverall a decent experience but nothing to write home about. Maybe we'll come back and try something new on the menu.",

Amazzzzing!  Their mac and cheese is really good, but I think the pasta is a little too mushy for me ( I think because they probably make a big batch in the morning and just have it sit all day).\n\nI love how they are changing their menu to where everything is going to be \"clean\" food, so no preservatives, or basically anything not good for us lol.  The staff here can honestly be hit or miss, sometimes you get someone that asks how your day was or smiles and sometimes you get someone that looks like they rather be somewhere else.

I'm not talking about just crumbs, but whole chunks of meat, pieces of lettuce, spilled soup... The tile isn't any better. Some areas were sticky where others showed obvious spill outlines of dirt and dust. Either the people who eat at Panera are the filthiest eaters on the planet or the staff just doesn't care. It's easy to dismiss a little mess as the result of some lunch/dinner rush, but if you look closer, you will see an obvious apathy towards cleanliness that is only addressed at the close of business.\n\nWhile we, as adults, know better, it is not uncommon for a toddler to explore his surroundings as mine did. Unfortunately, there is a one inch gap between the seat and the wall. This design flaw leaves a perfect hiding place for dropped food. A diligent restaurant would recognize this and clean such a space often. This restaurant failed to do this. As a result, I spent Father's Day eve caring for my son who spent the night throwing up everything. I've been to a good number of restaurants with this same gap and yet, Ive never had to worry about it not being clean. Absolutely disgusting. \n\nAnd if you still decide to brave the squalor of the dining room, do not order the brownie. They look beautiful, but have the consistency of adobe. My BBQ chicken salad was good as was the wife's sandwich/soup. It's a shame they don't take more pride in their dining area.",

          "I got hooked on Panera's bagels years ago in Maryland. The Timonium location provided me with a baker's dozen of bagels no matter what hour the hour.  Now I frequent three Albuquerque locations despite the difficulty I have getting them to complete a bagel order successfully. My first visit to their new location resulted in a botched bagel slicing job. The bagel tops were paper thin so they burn in the toaster. I guess they did not test the the slicing machine settings before opening day. Next, I asked for my order to be bagged and got a box instead. Oh did I mention they did not have stock of multigrain? They never do! Hint hint, stock more multigrain? They must have a huge employee turnover. Seems every visit the help does not know how to slice, ring up and bag bagels. Oy vey! They are delicious bagels so I will persevere.",

The customer service is excellent. On my most recent visit I ordered an apple as a side. When they brought the meal I asked for a knife to cut the apple, since my 11 month old can't bite into it. The employee did one better and brought me a sliced apple.\n\nIt can get a bit packed in here and the lines get long at times. They move quickly enough and their bread is worth the wait!",

I had a veggie sandwich on the black pepper focaccia with the vegetable soup and chips and herbal tea....it was yummy!

When I moved back West, it was nice to see it again.\n\nWhen my daughter went to high school, I used to call in and have her Friday lunch treat ready for me to pick up. It was nice that they had lunch items ready to pick up before 11:00 AM. If we have houseguests, I usually pick up an assortment of bagels and pastries then replate them, which always goes well and you don't have to cook in the morning;).\n\nThe pastries and bagels are good, especially the scones and is well complimented with a plain cup of coffee. One household and office fave were the French toast bagels, as they were the first to go. I'm not too fond of their specialty coffees that are sweet. In my opinion, they are a bit too sweet. \n\nThe location is off of Eastern and there is ample parking. You can always call in your order if you are doing take away. It's very convenient.\n\nALSO, take advantage of their Panera card. You do get free items like a pastry or bagel. With the card, you also get a free birthday pasty which I took advantage of today.",

The panini had chicken and melted cheese on a delicious focaccia bread. Another really tasty part of my lunch. More than filling. And they threw in a free Apple for dessert. All that for about eight and a half dollars. A good deal. Not gourmet. But very tasty and very reasonably priced.",

Then, whomever decided to toss three fingernail scrapings of BBQ chicken into an Italian seasoned dish must either hate their customers or must want the customers to hate Panera. Well, it worked. Now to the God-awful BBQ chicken. First of all there were 4 fingernail sized scrapings of chicken in the dish. I HATE BBQ, so that was good, but what a rip-off.

Nope, my impression of the place was ruined by the filthiness of the bathrooms.  After I placed my order, I went to use the ladies' room. It was absolutely gross--not just messy and needing a quick clean. The kind of grime on the floors, in the corners, and around the base of the stall walls wasn't from a busy day or even week. I don't think those floors have been properly scrubbed and mopped ever!  The restaurant didn't seem short-staffed either. I counted at least 6 employees at the counters.

The Turkey artichoke sandwgich does not even have artichokes in it. Totally different than it was a year ago. Its a cream cheese artichoke spread, which ended up making me sick. The turkey tasted like chicken and was cold and hard and tough. Nothing like the warm gooey sandwich it used to be. \n      Also...be aware.... the 6.99 any 2 price is only for like 5 sandwiches and a few salads. You have to add an additional dollar for anything else, and then 55 MORE cents to get half the menu. So- before drink, you have already spent almost 10 bucks...when the board says 6.99. Now, back to sandwich....once again, either the cream cheese or the turkey made me sick. About an hour later, still starving, I was out for the count for about 3 hours. Since the only thing I ate was 1/2 of a 1/2 of sandwich from here... the only thing that could have made me sick was the food. Just an FYI!",

I come here to use their internet and have lunch, but even if I don't buy anything sometimes, they never find it necessary to boot me out or refuse service to me. I usually sit in a booth because of the big table space, and its good for some private seclusion from everything else that's going on in the cafe. It helps me focus more. \n\nThe great pro about this place:\nThey have an awesome you pick two deal which is an option to choose two of any three: cup of soup, 1/2 a cafe sandwich, or 1/2 a cafe salad for 6.99. \nThey also have a member rewards card that's free for every time you come. Which has a whole bunch of benefits (I honestly haven't read the benefits yet because I just signed up).\nThe service is great!

I wanted to get a lot of work done, and I needed a little milky treat to get me started.  After a few minutes I went back up to pick up the drink but the girl was still working on it (even though there were no other drink orders other than mine).  I stand up there, and I can hear that the girl is not aerating my milk at all.  She's just keeping the wand all the way at the bottom of the pitcher.  Bad sign.  About 5 minutes later, I finally got my drink.  I was excited to finally have my warm, delicious chai, but I was so disappointed when I took off the lid and saw a thick skin on my milk.  \n\nHaving worked at coffee shops for many years, I knew that this meant that the girl had seriously scalded my milk.  I took it back up and asked her to remake it.  Now, let me tell you something.  I never complain about food or drinks.  I usually just live with it and/or throw it out.  But I don't complain.  This was disgusting, though, and I knew that if they remade it without scalding the milk, it would be fine.  The girl reluctantly agreed to make it, but only after acting like I was crazy and telling me that milk skin is normal.  Umm...no.\n\nSo she makes it again and when I get it, I take off the lid to check it out.  This time there's no skin, but my drink is curiously only 3/4 full.  I think, \"she did this on purpose to get back at me for having to remake my drink.\"  Instead of having her make it a third time, I ask for my money back.  They get the manager, who gives me a refund.  As I am getting my stuff to leave, the two girls behind the counter are audibly talking bad about me and laughing.\n\nI will never, ever come back to this location.",

          "I have not been to Panera in about 2 years. The last time I was here I used the WiFi and got a virus on my laptop. Which was horrible & costly to fix. So I figure enough time has passed & I missed the good food so I stopped in with my step daughter and our kids. We both ordered a soup & sandwich combo. We both had creamy tomato soup which was so yummy. My daugter also enjoyed her veggie sandwich. I had the italian which was ok. The bread was the highlight not the meat. I also had a yummy latte. The boys split a grilled cheese..which looked kinda boring. But whatever..it was for the kids. Our bill was 25 bucks so not that bad since we all left full and happy. I will not wait another 2 years to visit again..but I will never use their WiFi again.",

          "I usually the pick two meal deal. You can pick two choices between the cafe salads, soups and cafe sandwiches. The signature salads and signature sandwiches are about $.80 more than the cafe. \n\nI got the broccoli cheddar soup and the caesar salad. Their broccoli cheddar soup is sooo delicious! Not the thick goopy gunk I get from Einstein Bagels. It has carrots in it and is more of a soupy consistency. The caesar salad was okay. It was topped with Assiago cheese and their own homemade croutons. The boyfriend got the greek salad, topped with red onions, kalamata olives, peppercini pepper with greek dressing. I should have gotten that one too! He also got the turkey mesquite sandwich which I had gotten the last time we went there. \n\nThis time around we got the mango smoothie and the frozen strawberry lemonade! I didn't care much for the mango smoothie. It tasted more like bananas to me than mango, but my boyfriend didn't think so. The frozen strawberry lemonade was nice and tangy and extremely refreshing on this hot and surprisingly humid day! \n\nThey also have freshly baked bread and other treats like bear claws, muffins, cookies, etc. I have not tried any of their baked goods yet.",

          "Unlike the locations back in Texas, the Iced Green Tea at this location is served to you and you cannot get any refills, unless you want to pay full price for another glass of it. The food is typical Panera, but the lack of free refills on the Green Tea somewhat frustrated me. \n\nI have a love/hate relationship with Panera because some of their samdwiches are unique, but their overall prices are much higher than other delis and you end up leaving there with a bill similar to eating at a sit down casual restaurant.",

The soups are not bad. The different types of bread can make one go crazy in choosing. Either way this place is great.",

The cinnamon toast crunch is really popular, so come early or else they may be out of it.  So so so yummy!  Their sandwiches and soups are pretty good, too.  Another plus, is their free Wi-Fi.  It's a great place to study on a weekend!",

The employees where flirting and playing grab ass while there was a line almost out the door  My mil ordered 2 bagel packs and when I went to pick them up, they didn't have her order. Well the order was there, but under Rita not Laura.  I asked for them to double check that everything was there and they did, but when I got home my mil noticed that they didn't put the cream cheese in.  Back to Panera I went.  I just skipped the line and went to the girl that rang me up (She was making coffee at the time).  \nI think next time I'll have my mil tell me what she ordered so I can double check it myself.",

Their selection includes pastries, sandwiches, soups, salads, wraps and beverages like coffees and teas.  The staff was all very friendly.  I ordered a chicken soup and salad combo and when the server found me he told me he thought my soup might have gotten cold, so he brought me a new one.  I thought that was very kind.   It's a large cafe with comfy sofas and chairs to lounge in.  They also have internet access if you want to bring you laptop in.  It's bright, clean and airy.  The bread is yummy.",
