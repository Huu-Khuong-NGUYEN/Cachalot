Running "booking marketplace"
==============================================

This demo client implements a toy booking site, as described in the user guide (it can be found [here>>](https://github.com/usinesoft/Cachalot/blob/master/Doc/CachalotUserGuide.pdf))

It is mostly a showcase of the massive feeding and querying capabilities of the database.

To run this client, a server must be started on port **4848**. ( which is the default unless specified otherwise in **node_config.json**)
